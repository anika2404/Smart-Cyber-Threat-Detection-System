# Smart-Cyber-Threat-Detection-System
AI-powered Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) system that analyzes network traffic, detects cyber attacks using machine learning, and generates interactive dashboards and automated forensic reports.
# AI DFIR Tool

###  AI-Powered Cyber Threat Detection & Digital Forensics System

> **From raw network traffic → to intelligent cyber insights in seconds**

---

##  Overview

AI DFIR Tool is an intelligent **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** platform that analyzes network traffic data, detects malicious activity using machine learning, and presents actionable insights through an interactive dashboard and automated forensic reports.

---

##  Problem Statement

Analyzing large-scale network traffic to detect cyber threats is complex and time-consuming. Traditional systems lack real-time intelligence and clear visualization.

This project provides an **AI-driven solution** to:

* Automatically detect intrusions
* Classify cyber attacks
* Visualize network behavior
* Generate forensic reports instantly

---

##  Features

*  AI-Based Attack Detection
*  Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)
*  Real-Time Traffic Analysis
*  Attack Classification (DoS, Exploits, etc.)
*  Automated PDF Report Generation
*  Fast API Backend (FastAPI)
*  CSV Upload & Analysis
